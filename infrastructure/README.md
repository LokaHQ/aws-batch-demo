## CDK Bootstrap

Before using CDK in an AWS Account and Region, the Account + Region needs to be "cdk bootstraped"

```
# check if your aws is properly configured
aws sts get-caller-identity

# bootstrap cdk for the account and region
yarn cdk bootstrap
```

This **only needs to be done once** in the history of the account/region.
